# System Identification with Lipschitz Regularized Neural Networks
We use neural networks to learn governing equations from data. Specifically
we reconstruct the right-hand side of a system of ODEs <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\dot{x}(t)=f(t, x(t))"> directly
from observed uniformly time-sampled data using a neural network. In contrast with
other neural network based approaches to this problem, we add a Lipschitz regularization
term to our loss function. In the synthetic examples we observed empirically that
this regularization results in a smoother approximating function and better generalization
properties when compared with non-regularized models, both on trajectory and
non-trajectory data, especially in presence of noise. In contrast with sparse regression
approaches, since neural networks are universal approximators, we donâ€™t need any prior
knowledge on the ODE system. Since the model is applied component wise, it can
handle systems of any dimension, making it usable for real-world data.
